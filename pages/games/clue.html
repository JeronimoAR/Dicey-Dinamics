                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    You have been invited to tech billionaire Miles Bron's Glass Onion island for a 3-day weekend getaway
                    to solve a murder mystery alongside your mentor, master detective, Benoit Blanc. What started off as 
                    a game has suddenly become all too real after one of the guests is murdered. You and Detective Blanc
                    must work together with the remaining guests to find out who the killer is! Beware, because the killer
                    also has an accomplice. Use your detective skills to solve the mystery before the killer murders the
                    majority of the guests, or else he or she will murder you too! A mix of the famous games Clue and Mafia,
                    this game is a party game like no other that will test your cunning and intuition.
